description: Build compelling scientific narratives for grant proposals and research papers. Use when writing or revising research proposals, grant applications, project introductions, or any scientific text requiring persuasive storytelling. Helps construct conflict-driven narratives, design crucial experiments, and validate scientific significance through the "three soul questions" framework.

# Scientific Story

Transform research ideas into compelling scientific narratives that convince reviewers and readers of the work's necessity, uniqueness, and impact.

## Core Philosophy

Scientific writing fails not because the science is weak, but because the **value presentation** is unclear. This skill helps build a "scientific detective story" that engages reviewers and makes them want to fund or publish the work.

## The Four-Act Narrative Structure

Apply this structure to abstracts, introductions, and grant proposals.

### Act 1: The Target (树立靶子)
- Clearly state the mainstream, successful theory or model in the field
- Acknowledge its achievements and how it has driven progress
- Establish common ground with the reviewer

### Act 2: The Crack (揭示裂痕)
- Systematically identify what the mainstream model cannot explain
- Cite the strongest, most contradictory evidence
- Expose key exceptions and clinical paradoxes
- Build tension: "Something doesn't add up"

### Act 3: The Key (亮出钥匙)
- Based on the cracks, naturally lead to your insight
- Present preliminary data suggesting an unrecognized mechanism
- Show "clues" that point toward your hypothesis
- Position yourself as the only one who can solve this puzzle

### Act 4: The Solution (提出方案)
- State your core scientific hypothesis clearly
- Outline how you will test it through this project
- Promise to resolve the opening tension

## Crucial Experiment Design

Design research plans as "decapitation strikes" — precise, decisive operations.

### The Progressive Siege Logic
Structure 3-4 core research aims as a tightening logical sequence:

| Stage | Question | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| 1 | "Does it exist?" | Establish phenomenon |
| 2 | "Is it necessary?" | Prove causal requirement |
| 3 | "How does it work?" | Uncover mechanism |
| 4 | "Does it hold in complex systems?" | Validate broadly |

Each experiment should be a **crucial test** that can directly prove or disprove a sub-hypothesis.

### The Failure Contingency
After each key experiment, include:
> "If result A, it indicates X, and we will proceed with analysis Y; if result B, it indicates Z, and the project will pivot to direction W."

This signals mature scientific thinking, not mechanical experiment execution.

## The Three Soul Questions

Before finalizing any section, validate with these three questions:

### 1. The Necessity Test
**"If this project is not done, what will the scientific community lose?"**

- Forces articulation of the knowledge gap
- Justifies why this work cannot wait
- Answers: Why now? Why this?

### 2. The Uniqueness Test
**"Why must the answer be discovered by you, at this time, with this approach?"**

- Demonstrates unique expertise or access
- Justifies methodological choices
- Establishes competitive advantage

### 3. The Legacy Test
**"Three years from now, what is the one contribution this project will be remembered for?"**

- Forces focus on a single, clear impact
- Prevents "kitchen sink" proposals
- Creates a memorable takeaway

## Title and Abstract Strategy

### Title: Challenge, Don't State

**Weak (safe death):** "The role of XX gene in YY disease"
- Only states scope
- No scientific urgency

**Strong (compelling):** "Challenging the 'metabolic homeostasis' paradigm: Revealing the non-canonical function of XX gene driving YY disease progression"
- Signals paradigm disruption
- Indicates new mechanism
- Creates immediate tension

### Abstract: Story Arc in Miniature

Structure as a complete micro-story:

1. **Opening**: Identify a recognized pain point or contradiction in the field
2. **Middle**: State your core hypothesis and 1-2 key preliminary findings
3. **Closing**: Explicitly state how this work will solve the opening problem and fill the knowledge gap

This "beginning-middle-end" structure is non-negotiable.

## Application Workflows

### For Grant Proposals

1. Identify the dominant paradigm in your field (Act 1)
2. Gather 3-5 contradictory findings or unresolved paradoxes (Act 2)
3. Articulate your unique insight that bridges the gaps (Act 3)
4. Structure aims as crucial experiments with failure contingencies (Act 4)
5. Validate with the Three Soul Questions
6. Rewrite the title to challenge, not describe
7. Refine the abstract into a complete story arc

### For Paper Introductions

1. Open with the established model (1 paragraph)
2. Present the specific gap or contradiction your work addresses (1-2 paragraphs)
3. State your hypothesis and approach (1 paragraph)
4. Preview your key findings and their significance (1 paragraph)

### For Revision

When revising existing text:
1. Label each paragraph with its Act (1-4)
2. Identify missing Acts or imbalanced structure
3. Check every experiment for a failure contingency
4. Apply the Three Soul Questions to the overall project
5. Test the title for challenge language

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Literature review syndrome**: Listing papers to prove you "did your homework" instead of building a case
- **Kitchen sink approach**: Including every possible experiment rather than decisive crucial tests
- **Student mindset**: Presenting work as "what I will do" rather than "the solution only I can provide"
- **Passive voice overdose**: Hiding agency and conviction behind weak constructions
- **Absent failure plans**: Suggesting you haven't thought deeply about the science

## Transformation Checklist

Before submission, verify:

- [ ] Title contains a challenge word or paradigm disruption
- [ ] Abstract follows beginning-middle-end structure
- [ ] Introduction builds a scientific detective story
- [ ] Each aim is a crucial, decisive experiment
- [ ] Failure contingencies exist for key experiments
- [ ] Three Soul Questions can be answered clearly
- [ ] The work feels like an invitation to important science, not a funding request
